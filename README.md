**Project Description:**

•	We analyzed data from a local tuition free charter high school based in Austin, Texas. The school serves adult learners ranging in age from 18 years old to 50 years old and has been the only TEA authorized school to provide a high school diploma to adults beyond 26 years old for the last 10 years. A problem the school faces is a high dropout rate compared to graduates and total students enrolled per school year. 



**Research Questions and Conclusions:** 

•	What trends are present in graduation and dropout rates based on demographics?
  
  Analysis Conclusion:
            
            Average Age Comparison Time Series: A first step analysis looked at student demographics in order to analyze trends through the school years. The school opened in August of 2014 and data was provided through this month of 2024. We can see the age increased as the years progressed with both students who graduated and students who dropped out. Also apparent is the age gap between the 2 sets of students, where graduate students were 2 to 7 years older than their peers who did not graduate.  Another interesting note is that although the school serves students though the age of 50 years of age, the average age only spans upper 20’s through mid 30’s. 
            
            Male and Female Comparison Time Seriers: Male and female percentage trends were analyzed next through the same school years, 2014 through current school year. The lighter blue and green lines represent male and female dropout rates, respectively while the darker blue and green represent male and female graduation rates. While we have a higher female ratio compared to men in both groups, the female and male dropout rates stay somewhat consistent. On the other hand, the rates for graduates are more extreme when female and males are compared, with females are the majority of graduates each school year, ranging from 73%-80%. However, after school year 2018-2019, we see a decline in female rates and an incline in male graduate rates. The trend continues for the current school year where we see 76% of current graduates are males while only 24% of graduates are female. 
            
•	How has COVID impacted graduation numbers, pre and post pandemic?

  Analysis Conclusion:

    Despite expectations of a significant impact on graduation rates during the COVID-19 pandemic, our analysis revealed a surprising trend: while dropout rates increased notably, graduation rates remained relatively stable.

    Several factors may have contributed to this discrepancy. Disruptions in the learning environment, economic hardships, mental health challenges, disparities in access to resources, and limited support systems could have intensified the pressures faced by students, leading to higher dropout rates. Conversely, delayed impacts on graduation rates, changes in institutional policies, and the resilience of students and academic institutions in adapting to remote learning may have mitigated the immediate effects on graduation rates. Understanding these dynamics is crucial for developing targeted interventions to support student retention and success in the face of ongoing challenges posed by the pandemic.


•	How does weather impact graduate rates and dropout rates?

Analysis Conclusion: 

    By examining the scatter plot, we can see seasonal patterns in graduation rates. Graduations tend to peak during certain months with warmer temperatures. Outliers might result from factors like extreme weather events or changes in academic policies. Other factors can be holidays, people tend to go out of town for family gatherings. 
    We can see how weather conditions influence student withdrawal decisions, around August. For example, before Fall and Winter, if there's a spike in withdrawals during extreme weather events or seasons with unfavorable conditions, it suggests a weather-related impact or holiday family gathering. In conclusion, students tend to plan their withdrawals before Fall & Winter, which can imply the outcome of less graduates compared to the Spring & Summer. 



**Datasets Used:**

•	Skyward Student database (de-identified data provided to protect student information and abide by FERPA regulations)

•	Open Weather API



**Data Analysis Methods used:** 

• Time Series Analysis: We analyzed trends over time to provide insights into various phenomena, including changes in student behavior, environmental factors, and more. We chose this method to help schools, researchers, and policymakers make informed decisions and predictions based on historical data patterns.

• Exploratory Data Analysis: We visually explored and analyzed data to discover patterns, trends, and relationships. The techniques such as pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots to gain insights into the dataset's structure and characteristics.


**SUMMARY ANALYSIS & TAKEAWAYS:**
--
•	Gender Disparities in Graduation and Dropout Rates: Analysis of gender percentages among graduates and non-graduates reveals persistent disparities over the years. While the exact magnitude and direction of these disparities may vary, addressing gender gaps in educational attainment remains an ongoing challenge.

•	Trends in Graduation and Dropout Rates Over Time: Examination of graduation and dropout rates across different school years highlights fluctuations and trends in student outcomes. Identifying periods of improvement or decline can inform targeted interventions and resource allocation efforts aimed at improving overall educational outcomes.

•	Seasonal Distribution of Graduations: Analysis of graduation distribution by season indicates a consistent pattern of higher graduations during the spring and summer months. Understanding these seasonal trends can help institutions better plan for ceremonies, allocate resources, and engage with students and alumni.

•	Average Age of Graduates and Dropouts: Tracking the average age of graduates and dropouts over time provides insights into demographic trends and student retention dynamics. Changes in average age may reflect shifts in enrollment patterns, program completion rates, or other factors influencing student outcomes.

•	Impact of External Factors: Consideration of external factors, such as economic conditions or public health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic, is crucial for contextualizing trends in educational data. External events can significantly influence graduation rates, dropout patterns, and other indicators of student success.

•	Strategic Implications for Educational Institutions: The data analysis underscores the importance of strategic planning and data-informed decision-making for educational institutions. Insights derived from the data can guide efforts to improve student retention, enhance support services, and promote equity and inclusion across diverse student populations.

•	Opportunities for Further Research and Analysis: While the provided scripts offer valuable insights, there are opportunities for further research and analysis. Exploring additional variables, conducting longitudinal studies, and employing advanced statistical techniques can deepen our understanding of the complex factors shaping educational outcomes.

•	Overall, the data analysis highlights the multifaceted nature of student success and the importance of adopting a holistic approach to address challenges and promote positive outcomes in education. By leveraging data-driven insights, educational institutions can better support students, foster inclusive learning environments, and drive continuous improvement in educational outcomes.
