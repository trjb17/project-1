**Project Title:** Diplomas and Detours: An Analysis of Graduation and Dropout Trends


**Team Members**: Jorge Torres, Kristopher Melton, Krissina Wells, Angelica Sandel, Trevor Sandoval


**Project Description:**

•	We analyzed data from a local tuition free charter high school based in Austin, Texas. The school serves adult learners ranging in age from 18 years old to 50 years old and has been the only TEA authorized school to provide a high school diploma to adults beyond 26 years old for the last 10 years. A problem the school faces is a high dropout rate compared to graduates and total students enrolled per school year. 



**Research Questions to Answer:** 

•	What trends are present in graduation and dropout rates based on demographics?
  Analysis Conclusion:
            Average Age Comparison Time Series: A first step analysis looked at student demographics in order to analyze trends through the school years. The school opened in August of 2014 and data was provided through this month of 2024. We can see the age increased as the years progressed with both students who graduated and students who dropped out. Also apparent is the age gap between the 2 sets of students, where graduate students were 2 to 7 years older than their peers who did not graduate.  Another interesting note is that although the school serves students though the age of 50 years of age, the average age only spans upper 20’s through mid 30’s. 
            Male and Female Comparison Time Seriers: Male and female percentage trends were analyzed next through the same school years, 2014 through current school year. The lighter blue and green lines represent male and female dropout rates, respectively while the darker blue and green represent male and female graduation rates. While we have a higher female ratio compared to men in both groups, the female and male dropout rates stay somewhat consistent. On the other hand, the rates for graduates are more extreme when female and males are compared, with females are the majority of graduates each school year, ranging from 73%-80%. However, after school year 2018-2019, we see a decline in female rates and an incline in male graduate rates. The trend continues for the current school year where we see 76% of current graduates are males while only 24% of graduates are female. 
            
•	How has COVID impacted graduation numbers, pre and post pandemic?

•	How does weather impact graduate rates and dropout rates?



**Datasets to Be Used:**

•	Skyward Student database (de-identified data provided to protect student information and abide by FERPA regulations)

•	Open Weather API



**Data Analysis Methods used:** 

• Time Series Analysis: We analyzed trends over time to provide insights into various phenomena, including changes in student behavior, environmental factors, and more. We chose this method to help schools, researchers, and policymakers make informed decisions and predictions based on historical data patterns.

• Exploratory Data Analysis: We visually explored and analyzed data to discover patterns, trends, and relationships. The techniques such as pie charts, scatter plots, and box plots to gain insights into the dataset's structure and characteristics.



**Rough Breakdown of Tasks:**

•	Kristopher: merge and clean data set

•	Jorge: weather comparison and graph, API connection

•	Krissina: pre-post covid trends, exploratory data analysis, create line plot.

•	Angelica: provide Skyward dataset, graduation rate and dropout rate trends, correlation, and graph

•	Trevor: presentation organization, overview of analysis
